# Parallel Uploads

**Project Status:** On Hiatus  

## Overview
Parallel Uploads is a personal project by **Azim Usmanov**, created to streamline the process of distributing short-form content across multiple platforms such as **TikTok**, **YouTube Shorts**, and **Instagram**. The goal is to enable creators to upload a single video and automatically publish it to all selected platforms, eliminating repetitive manual uploads.

## Objective
The long-term goal is to deploy a full backend and turn this into a functioning web application where users can:
- Upload short-form videos directly through a web interface  
- Choose which platforms to publish to  
- Automate uploading and publishing through secure API integrations  
- And any other features that might prove useful

## Technical Focus
This project serves as a learning platform for me to develop my skills in:
- **Backend development** and **REST API design**
- **AWS S3** file management and cloud storage
- **API integration** with the Meta Graph API, YouTube Data API, and TikTok API
- **Authentication**, **token management**, and secure environment variable handling
- Preparing for **cloud deployment** and scaling backend services
