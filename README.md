# 🎶 Parallel Uploads 🎶

Project currently on hiatus 

## 🚧WIP🚧
### Very Unfinished
Hi! My name is Azim Usmanov, and this summer, my friends and I developed a passion for creating and distributing music. 🎧

I built Parallel Uploads to streamline the process of promoting music, which often involves uploading short videos to platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram. 📱💻

The goal of Parallel Uploads is to help artists (or anyone!) upload their short videos simultaneously to the services of their choice, saving time and effort. 🚀

📌 Features
📹 Upload videos to multiple platforms at once: TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram
🎵 Perfect for music promotion: Share your content with ease
⚡ Efficient and streamlined: Spend less time uploading, and more time creating
